# Recruitment
Code to analyse the recruitment of organised crime groups in Mexico.

The code takes two inputs. Data related to cartels in Mexico in 2020 was obtained from open sources, including national and local newspapers and narco blogs and was compiled by CentroGeo, GeoInt and DataLab, part of Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnolog√≠a. The source of the data is here:
https://ppdata.politicadedrogas.org/

That data was transformed into two matrices. One with state alliances and one with state rivalries for the 150 active cartels.

The code takes the two matrices as an input and produces an estimate of cartel size and distribution. It produces also the number of murders and incapacitations by week. The model takes the 2012-2022 decade.
